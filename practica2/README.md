## Práctica 2. Funciones básicas de OpenCV

In this first assignment we have worked on image processing and for that we have used the OpenCV library in Python.

## Canny

In this exercise we calculatedj the rows that have the 0.95*maximum number of pixels that are white by row. And we have compare this result with the one gotten when calculating the maximum number of white pixels by columns

## Sobel

The main difference between the Sobel and the Canny, is that the Sobel is an umbralized image. We have calculated the maximun number of white pixels per row and column in this image and compared the results.
## 3 frames

We decided to show 3 frames to show how much an image changes when the colors. The 1 frame is the original, in 2 frame we have changed the value of rgb.

## Blue Boxes

In this video we decided to follow something similar to what the video "Virtual guitar" "My little piece of privacy" and paint a blue box on top of an object, and if the object were to move, so would the box.
